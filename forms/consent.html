<i>This consent form, a copy of which will be left with you for your records and reference,is only part of the process of informed consent. It should give you the basic idea ofwhat the research is about and what your participation will involve. If you would likemore detail about something mentioned here, or information not included here, youshould ask. Please take the time to read this carefully and to understand anyaccompanying information.</i><br/><br/>

<b>Purpose</b>: This experiment examines your ability to remember words. Your performance will be compared to computational models of semantic memory. This is done so in an effort to assess if they are descriptive models of human behavior.<br/><br/>

<b>Procedure</b>: 
In this experiment, you will be presented with a list of words, one at a time. Afterward, you will be shown a set of words, some of which you will have studied in the list, and some of which will be new. Your task will be to indicate whether each word did or did not appear in the study phase. All answers will be collected by the computer.<br/><br/>

<b>Risks and benefits</b>:
There are typically no risks involved, greater than that which you might experience in the normal conduct of your everyday. If you become tired, you should take a break. You are free to discontinue participation at any time and with no consequences. You will benefit from participating by gaining experience with scientific research in psychology.<br/><br/>

<b>Your privacy</b>: Digital data files will be anonymous and kept indefinitely on a password protected laboratory computer. Hard copies of your data files will be anonymous and kept indefinitely in a file cabinet in the Cognitive Science laboratory at the University of Manitoba. This consent form will be kept in a cabinet in the Cognitive Science laboratory at the University of Manitoba. It will be destroyed on April 1, 2023.<br/><br/>

<b>Compensation</b>: You will receive 1 credit toward your final grade in Introductory Psychology (Psychology 1200).<br/><br/>

<b>Voluntary withdrawal</b>: Even after you consent to participate in the experiment, you can choose to withdraw your participation at any time and with no consequence. You will be debriefed and then you are free to leave the experiment without penalty. If you withdraw part way through the experiment, your data will be automatically deleted. If you withdraw after completing the experiment, your data will not be deleted as there is no way to link your identity to your response data.</b></i><br/><br/>

<b>Feedback</b>: Following the experiment, the research assistant will inform you of the experimentâ€™s aims and you will be told the expected results. If you are interested in learning the outcome of this specific experiment, please leave us with your email address or surface-mail address below. We will send you a description as soon as possible, but no later than April 30, 2022.<br/><br/>

<b>Dissemination</b>: The results of the study will be presented at academic conferences and published in academic journals. Results will also be part of a thesis.<br/><br/>

<b>Consent:</b> Please print a copy of this consent form for your records. If you wish to participate in the experiment please click the button to begin the study. <br/><br/>
