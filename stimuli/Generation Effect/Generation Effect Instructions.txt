Generation Effect Instructions

You will study a long list of cue-target pairs, e.g., bint - hint (bint is   
the cue and hint is the target). The cue and the target will always rhyme.   
For a given cue-target pair, both cue and target will be four-letter nonwords 
It is your job to study the cue-target pairs and to remember the target items   
for a memory test.                                                           

There will be two kinds of study trials:                                     

(A) On half the study trials both the cue and target will be spelt out for   
you, e.g., hint - bint.                                                      
-> When both the cue and target are spelt out your task is to read both 
items to yourself. You will have 3 seconds to read and study the pair.       

(B) On half the study trials the cue will be spelt out and the first letter  
of the target will be shown, e.g., hint - b___.                              
-> On these trials it is your task is to generate the rhyming target and then
read the cue and the target to yourself. You will have two seconds to   
read and study the pair after which the proper rhyming target will be shown  
for one second to confirm you generated the rhyming target correctly.        

Instructions for the memory test will be given after the study phase.        

               When you are ready to begin, press G (for GO).

Next, you will perform a recognition test. One of the items was a     
target item from the list that you just studied; the other has      
not occurred anywhere in the experiment.                           

                                               

Good luck.                                                         

           When ready for the test, press G (for GO).
